This project consists of 2 major parts: the price forecasting analysis notebook and the dash app. The price forecasting notebook demonstrates 3 different approaches: time series model (ARIMA), machine learning models (random forest, gradient boosting, xgboost), and deep learning models. The dash app is coded in python and two screenshots are shown as follows.
